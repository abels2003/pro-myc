    <p class="mt-3">
        Promyc® is a vegan mycoprotein ingredient produced through biotechnology via the fermentation process as a
        core.
        Our production process allows us to be a lot more efficient than traditional farming in terms of time, cost,
        and feedstock,
        with much less environmental impact. It also enables the decentralization of food production, making it
        possible to produce Promyc® wherever needed.

                Promyc® is in fact quite a boring ingredient — neutral colour, taste, and smell. But boring doesn’t
                necessarily mean a bad thing. Besides being excellent in color, taste, and smell, Promyc® is a
                sustainable mycoprotein ingredient that can be used to produce vegan food products and that brings a
                great source of fiber and protein, nutrition, and healthy vitamins while offering a great texture.
